# Indeed_JobScrap

Job Search is a Daunting task ! 

Checking multiple website for job posting, reading through the job description understanding the expectations and visiting the company's page to understand more on it !
surely takes up a good amount of our time...

To make things easy.. and also to help myself in my job search 

I worked on this project to aid in:-

1. Finding all Job posting on Indeed related to a particular field ('Job Title')
2. Scrap all job posting data into a CSV format and Pandas Dataframe 
3. To help better understand the company, the code also scrap individual company data by requesting data from each company website and stitching it togther with Job posting Data.


Hope this helps you in your Job Search !

Thank You.

Feel free to suggest modification and changes to increase the effectiveness..
